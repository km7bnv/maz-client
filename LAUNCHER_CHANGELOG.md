## 0.6.59
- Added a **Minecraft version selector for MazClient** directly inside the normal MazLauncher.
- MazClient can now launch either the normal **Minecraft 26.2** build or the separate **Minecraft 1.21.11** compatibility build without installing a second launcher.
- Minecraft 1.21.11 uses its own isolated installation directory, Fabric profile, compatible dependency set, and MazClient JAR so its mods/config/cache cannot collide with 26.2.
- The 1.21.11 profile intentionally uses a smaller compatibility-first managed mod set; optional performance mods are skipped instead of blocking launch when a compatible build is unavailable.
- MazLauncher advances from **0.6.58** to **0.6.59**. MazClient remains **1.11.0** on both supported Minecraft lines.

## 0.6.58
- Brought **Record-able** back as an **optional recording add-on** instead of a permanently loaded managed mod.
- Added an **ENABLE RECORDER / DISABLE RECORDER** control in the Mods tab for each MazClient installation.
- Normal mode keeps Record-able completely absent from the active mods folder, preserving the smoother performance restored in 0.6.57.
- Enabling the recorder installs the bundled verified Fabric 26.2 Record-able JAR for that MazClient version; disabling it removes the JAR again so it cannot consume resources during normal play.
- The recorder remains packaged inside the installer for fast/offline enablement, but it is not loaded by Fabric unless the user explicitly enables recording mode.
- Record-able's current 26.2 releases provide low-end performance presets, adaptive capture rate, hardware encoding support and Deferred Capture for lower gameplay overhead while recording.
- MazLauncher advances from **0.6.57** to **0.6.58**. MazClient remains **1.11.0**.

## 0.6.57
- Removed **Record-able** from MazLauncher's required managed mod stack after it caused unacceptable performance overhead in normal gameplay.
- Fresh installs no longer bundle or synchronize Record-able.
- Upgrading existing MazClient installations now removes leftover `record-able*.jar` and `record-able*.jar.disabled` files from the instance mods folder so the recorder does not remain active after the launcher update.
- All other managed mods, including Mouse Tweaks and the performance stack, remain unchanged.
- MazLauncher advances from **0.6.56** to **0.6.57**.

## 0.6.56
- Added **Record-able** for Fabric 26.2 to the required managed mod stack.
- Record-able provides direct in-game gameplay/video and game-audio recording with configurable start/stop recording keybinds, replay-buffer saves, bookmarks, settings hotkeys, cancel recording, and other bindable controls.
- The mod supports hardware encoders such as NVENC, AMF, and QuickSync and can download FFmpeg on first use instead of requiring a bundled FFmpeg binary.
- MazLauncher now resolves, bundles, synchronizes, protects, and verifies Record-able with the rest of the managed stack.
- MazLauncher advances from **0.6.55** to **0.6.56**.

## 0.6.55
- Added **Mouse Tweaks 2.31 for Fabric 26.2** to the required managed mod stack.
- Mouse Tweaks improves inventory handling with enhanced RMB dragging, LMB drag interactions, and scroll-wheel item movement.
- The mod is client-side and uses the already-managed Fabric API dependency.
- MazLauncher now resolves, bundles, synchronizes, protects, and verifies Mouse Tweaks with the rest of the managed stack.
- MazLauncher advances from **0.6.54** to **0.6.55**.

## 0.6.54
- Fixed a startup-blocking dependency error introduced with Fast Noise: **zconfig** is now included as a required managed Minecraft 26.2 Fabric mod.
- MazLauncher now resolves, bundles, synchronizes, protects, and verifies zconfig alongside Fast Noise so Fabric can satisfy Fast Noise's `zconfig >= 1.0.0+26.x` requirement.
- Existing MazClient 1.10.19 installs receive zconfig through the same managed-mod synchronization path before launch.
- MazLauncher advances from **0.6.53** to **0.6.54**.

## 0.6.53
- Added **More Culling** to the always-on managed Minecraft 26.2 Fabric stack to skip additional hidden block/model surfaces and reduce unnecessary rendering work.
- Added **Cloth Config API**, required by More Culling's 26.2 Fabric release.
- Added **Fast Noise** to reduce vanilla world-generation CPU cost and smooth chunk-generation/loading spikes while preserving vanilla-compatible generation behavior.
- Kept **C2ME** out of the required stack for now because its Minecraft 26.2 builds are beta/alpha rather than release-grade; MazLauncher continues to require stable release builds for managed mods.
- These optimizations are always present in MazClient installations and are not exposed as MazClient toggle modules.
- MazLauncher advances from **0.6.52** to **0.6.53**.

## 0.6.52
- Added **Quick Exp** to the managed Minecraft 26.2 Fabric stack as the compatible rapid XP-bottle mod for this Minecraft version.
- Added **Multi Key Bindings** to the managed stack so players can assign multiple keys and modifier combinations to the same Minecraft action.
- Both mods are now resolved, bundled into the installer payload, synchronized into MazClient instances, and treated as required managed mods by MazLauncher.
- MazLauncher advances from **0.6.51** to **0.6.52**.

## 0.6.51
- Fixed the Skins tab cape preview so imported cape PNGs render as a separate cape model behind the player instead of appearing almost flush against the base body.
- Preserved Minecraft's standard cape UV mapping while adding a small shoulder offset/angle so the cape reads as its own layer in the 3D preview.
- Added a **RESET** button beside **IMPORT CAPE PNG** that clears the local cape preview and cape selection without changing the skin or the Minecraft account's active cape.
- MazLauncher advances from **0.6.50** to **0.6.51**.

## 0.6.50
- Fixed the launcher Mod List so opening it synchronizes the CI-bundled required mod JARs into the selected MazClient instance before enumerating installed mods.
- Required managed mods now physically appear in the instance mods directory and Mod List without requiring a game launch first.
- MazLauncher advances from **0.6.49** to **0.6.50**.

## 0.6.49
- Fixed bundled managed-mod installation to use a release-generated project-to-filename manifest instead of guessed filename prefixes.
- This fixes bundled JAR discovery for real filenames such as WalksyLib, shieldfixes, CrosshairAddons and uku's Armor HUD.
- MazLauncher now copies the exact CI-downloaded JAR for each required project into the launched MazClient instance's mods directory and validates the copied file before launch.
- MazLauncher advances from **0.6.48** to **0.6.49**.

# MazLauncher Changelog

## 0.6.48
- Bundles the complete requested Fabric 26.2 managed mod stack inside the MazLauncher installer and installs those exact JARs into the active MazClient version directory before using the network fallback.
- Keeps fail-closed managed-mod verification, so a missing bundled/downloaded JAR cannot silently produce a partial client.
- MazLauncher advances from **0.6.47** to **0.6.48**.

## 0.6.47
- Made the expanded managed mod stack fail-closed: MazLauncher now records the exact JAR resolved for every required mod and verifies that file exists after installation/cache fallback.
- A failed or missing required mod now produces one explicit error naming every missing/failed Modrinth project instead of allowing MazClient to launch with a silently incomplete stack.
- Offline fallback remains supported only when a previously downloaded matching managed JAR is actually present.
- MazLauncher advances from **0.6.46** to **0.6.47**.

## 0.6.46
- Fixed ComboBox dropdown popup rows so their backgrounds, borders, hover state, selected state and text all follow MazLauncher's dynamic theme resources.
- Dark mode dropdowns now stay dark instead of mixing dark text/theme styling with Windows' light popup background; light mode continues to use the light palette.
- MazLauncher advances from **0.6.45** to **0.6.46**.

## 0.6.45
- Expanded the managed Minecraft 26.2 stack with Sodium Extra, Reese's Sodium Options, Balm, WalksyLib, Shield Fixes, Crosshair Addons Public, ukulib, TotemCounter, uku's Armor HUD, and Status Effect Timer.
- Keeps required libraries managed alongside their dependent mods and preserves offline fallback to already-cached JARs.
- Indium is intentionally excluded because modern Sodium provides Fabric Rendering API support itself and Indium is incompatible with Sodium 0.6+.
- MazLauncher advances from **0.6.44** to **0.6.45**.


Historical notes through **0.6.40** are preserved verbatim in `archive/LAUNCHER_CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE_0.6.40_AND_EARLIER.md`.

## 0.6.44

### Coalesced cloud-manifest reads
- Added a short-lived in-memory cache for the validated cloud manifest so launch/update paths that ask for the same manifest within 30 seconds reuse one result instead of repeating identical GitHub requests.
- Added a `SemaphoreSlim` gate around manifest refreshes so concurrent callers share one network/cache refresh instead of racing multiple downloads and cache writes.
- Online and offline manifest results both populate the same memory cache after successful parsing; malformed or unavailable manifests are never cached as valid state.
- Preserved the existing atomic on-disk manifest cache, 5-second network timeout, SHA256 verification, offline fallback, and launcher-update verification behavior.
- Existing MazClient config, HUD setup, managed performance mods, resource packs, account cache, offline operation, smart caching, Simple Voice Chat management, and disconnect stability remain unchanged.
- FPS Booster is unchanged and still never modifies render distance or simulation distance.

### Research notes
- Current Minecraft 26.2 client packs still commonly combine Sodium/Lithium with targeted optimizers such as ImmediatelyFast, Entity Culling, FerriteCore, ModernFix and related culling/loading tools. MazLauncher already covers the core managed stack, so this cycle avoids stacking another overlapping performance mod merely for feature count.
- Current 26.2 HUD/QoL clients commonly expose FPS, ping, coordinates and frame/memory diagnostics. MazClient already includes those capabilities, including detailed frame pacing and GC diagnostics, so this cycle focuses on launcher reliability rather than duplicating HUD modules.

### Versioning and distribution
- This is a **MazLauncher-only reliability release**. MazClient remains **1.9.16**.
- MazLauncher assembly and Inno Setup metadata are synchronized at **0.6.44**.
- Public GitHub Release assets remain limited to exactly one Windows EXE installer; raw MazClient and third-party mod JARs remain internal to the installer/cache path.

## 0.6.43

### Atomic cloud-manifest cache
- Changed MazLauncher's cloud manifest cache to use a write-to-temp + atomic replace path instead of writing directly over the last known-good cache file.
- A launcher interruption, disk hiccup, or process termination during a manifest refresh can no longer leave a partially written `latest-cloud-manifest.json` behind and destroy offline fallback state.
- Online manifest parsing and offline cached-manifest parsing now share the same deserialization path so fallback behavior stays consistent.
- Temporary manifest cache files are cleaned up on both success and failure.
- Existing MazClient config, HUD setup, managed performance mods, resource packs, account cache, offline operation, smart caching, Simple Voice Chat management, and disconnect stability remain unchanged.
- FPS Booster is unchanged and still never modifies render distance or simulation distance.

### Research notes
- Current Minecraft 26.2 Fabric performance stacks continue to center on Sodium/Lithium plus targeted rendering and memory optimizations; MazLauncher already manages Sodium, Lithium, ImmediatelyFast, Entity Culling, and FerriteCore, so this cycle avoids adding another overlapping optimization mod.
- Simple Voice Chat 2.6.22 is the current stable Minecraft 26.2 Fabric release observed during this cycle and includes fixes for reconnect races, audio initialization failures, OpenAL resource leaks, and speaker breakage. MazLauncher's existing Modrinth resolver already selects the latest stable compatible release automatically, so no hardcoded voice-chat version change is needed.

### Versioning and distribution
- This is a **MazLauncher-only reliability release**. MazClient remains **1.9.3**.
- MazLauncher assembly and Inno Setup metadata are synchronized at **0.6.43**.
- Public GitHub Release assets must remain limited to exactly one Windows EXE installer; raw MazClient and third-party mod JARs remain internal to the installer/cache path.

## 0.6.42

### 3D skin and cape appearance preview
- Replaced the flat skin-image preview path with an interactive **3D Minecraft player preview** built directly into MazLauncher. Imported skins are mapped onto the block model, Classic/Steve and Slim/Alex arm widths update live, and the model can be dragged to rotate or mouse-wheeled to zoom.
- Added cape support to the Skins tab. Signed-in users can load the capes their Minecraft account already owns, preview each cape on the same 3D player, activate an owned cape, or hide the currently active account cape.
- The launcher reads the signed-in profile from Minecraft Services and can also load the currently active account skin into the 3D preview when no local skin PNG has been selected.
- Added **custom cape PNG import for local 3D preview**. Standard 2:1 cape atlases such as 64x32, 128x64, and 256x128 are accepted and wrapped onto the 3D cape model.
- Custom cape PNGs are deliberately not presented as account uploads: Minecraft Services only allows activating a cape entitlement already owned by the signed-in account. The launcher explains this distinction instead of pretending an arbitrary cape can be uploaded to Mojang.
- Skin uploading continues to use the existing authenticated Minecraft Services skin endpoint; cape activation uses the account cape endpoint and never alters gameplay packets or server behavior.
- Existing MazClient config, HUD setup, managed performance mods, resource packs, account cache, offline behavior, smart caching, Simple Voice Chat management, and disconnect stability remain untouched.
- FPS Booster is unchanged and still never modifies render distance or simulation distance.

### Versioning and distribution
- This is a **MazLauncher-only appearance/QoL release**. MazClient remains **1.9.3**.
- MazLauncher assembly and Inno Setup metadata are synchronized at **0.6.42**.
- Public GitHub Release assets remain limited to exactly one Windows EXE installer; raw MazClient and third-party mod JARs remain internal to the installer/cache path.

## 0.6.41

### SmoothHud removal
- Removed **SmoothHud** from MazLauncher's managed Minecraft 26.2 Fabric stack. MazLauncher no longer resolves, downloads, validates, caches, or launches SmoothHud.
- Deleted the dedicated `SmoothHudService` integration and removed SmoothHud from managed-stack initialization.
- Expanded retired-mod cleanup so existing MazClient installations automatically delete legacy SmoothHud JARs, the `.maz-smoothhud` marker, and SmoothHud-named config files on launcher startup. This covers previously managed cached installs so upgrading users do not keep the mod or its leftover config after the integration is removed.
- BetterF3 retirement cleanup remains intact.
- Existing MazClient config, HUD setup, performance mods, resource packs, account cache, offline behavior, smart caching, Simple Voice Chat management, and disconnect stability remain untouched.
- FPS Booster is unchanged and still never modifies render distance or simulation distance.

### Versioning and distribution
- This is a **MazLauncher-only** removal/cleanup release. MazClient remains unchanged.
- MazLauncher assembly and Inno Setup metadata are synchronized at **0.6.41**.
- Public GitHub Release assets remain limited to exactly one Windows EXE installer; raw MazClient and third-party mod JARs remain internal to the installer/cache path.
